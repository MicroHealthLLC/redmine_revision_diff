= all_diff

A simple plugin to show the diff of a revision on the same page as the list of modified files.

I made it simple for now for my needs, using redmine 2.5 to test it and a git repo (as I only use git).
I'll add tests and try stuff for real (like different redmine versions and other SCM's) soon, but for now, this is how I made it for me.
